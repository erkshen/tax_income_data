# Tax/Income Data for Australia 1979-2020
Data sourced from [Australian Government](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-f1a2c3d5-98d0-46b7-8b8c-742e65c6afa7/details?q=)

This is a personal data visualisation project to investigate the data to see if there are any meaningful and novel trends that can be converted to an interesting visualisation.

## Workflow
- The data will be extracted, cleaned and reexported as an Excel file using the Pandas library from Python.
- The cleaned dataset will be loaded into Tableau for visualisation

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to become more familiar with using Tableau, in anticipation of similar visualisation software in future job prospects. As it is a learning exercise, it is more important to experiment with different visualisation methods rather than simple plots. It could also be interesting to see how to create the same style of visualisations in Tableau as in Python using matplotlib, plotly or seaborn.
